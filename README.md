# Data Structures & Algorithms â€“ Programming Assignments  

This repository contains my solutions to the **programming assignments** from the following two courses offered by the **University of California San Diego** on Coursera:  

- [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://coursera.org/share/7859e31e7fc5d066c4893fa2b10ae77e)ðŸ“œ  
- [Data Structures](https://coursera.org/share/06c76e242bb86b95f52998fd5d50aaef)ðŸ“œ

The assignments focus on developing efficient algorithms and fundamental data structures, combining both theoretical concepts and practical coding exercises.

## ðŸŽ“ About the Courses  

Both courses are part of UC San Diegoâ€™s [Data Structures and Algorithms series](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms). They emphasize not only solving problems correctly but also doing so efficiently, with a strong focus on performance analysis.
